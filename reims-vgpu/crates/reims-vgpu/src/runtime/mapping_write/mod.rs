///   matched no plane record, or — the case that matters — it matched more than
///   one. A v0a8 surface's Y and alpha planes are both R8 at the luma geometry,

        // costs, by an order of magnitude, and no reading of the two loops
        // explains it. The cache loop's share of the row loop went from 0.14 to

    //
    // This writer publishes nothing and used to stamp nothing, so a partial
    // store landed composite pixels in the guest's pages while
    // `host_surfaces[mapping_id]` kept the previous frame and
    // `mapping_guest_write_verdict` kept answering `Clean` — the device's own
    // writes go through a mapped host pointer and cannot set `DIRTY_MEMORY_VGA`
    // (`reims-vgpu-dirty.c`), so the hypervisor's witness cannot see them and
    // only the writer can. `draw::seed_from_published_surface` then served that
    // stale frame as the attachment's prior content, the pass composited onto
    // it, and its Store published the result back over the guest's pages: the
    // rect's pixels lost, and *held*, which is the exact class that door's
    // strict evidence standard exists to prevent.
    //
    // Retiring rather than repairing, because this writer holds rows in the
    // mapping's native layout and the cache holds a tight BGRA frame; building
    // the second from the first is the full-frame conversion the partial store
    // exists to avoid. A miss costs the next LOAD a guest read.
